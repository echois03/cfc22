        <p>The CFC is an annual church-wide event hosted at our church with the aim of blessing LCBC with biblical teaching on a specific, relevant topic. We are very thankful for how well last year's CFC turned out, and we hope and pray this can continue to become a yearly tradition for us. This year, the topic we want to address is what the Bible has to say on mental illness. To that end, we have invited Dr. Charles Hodges to speak.</p>
